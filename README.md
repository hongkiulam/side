# WebRTC Starter Kit
### Server/ Signalling
#### Using Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
This project sets up a simple Express/ Socket.IO server which acts as the signalling for the WebRTC application, which handles the basic exchange of offers between clients.

### Client/ WebRTC
#### HTML, CSS, JS

The front-end for this project is kept as minimal as possible, which shows a list of connected users, the local and remote video streams and call/ hangup buttons.
